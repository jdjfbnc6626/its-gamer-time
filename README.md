The component architecture of the page consists of a Home view; a Results List, which appears upon entering a search; and specific game Details Cards, which you can link to from a results list. The green to red Slider, always available with a search box, allows the user to restrict a search by dollar value. The Nav Bar allows returning home with the Game Time icon at the top left or entering a new search in the search box.
\
Home view - Note the price Slider available to restrict price.\
